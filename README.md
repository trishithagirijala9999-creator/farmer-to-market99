# 🌾 AgriDirect – West Godavari

Direct Digital Marketplace for Farmers and Buyers
AgriDirect is a digital farmer-to-market platform designed to connect farmers directly with buyers, helping farmers sell their agricultural produce without unnecessary middlemen.

The platform focuses on agricultural communities in West Godavari, Andhra Pradesh, providing a simple, bilingual, mobile-friendly marketplace where farmers can list their produce and buyers can discover and order fresh products directly from them.

🎯 Problem Statement
Farmers often depend on multiple intermediaries to sell their agricultural products. This can result in:

Lower earnings for farmers
Higher prices for buyers
Limited market access
Lack of price transparency
Difficulty finding direct customers
Limited digital tools for rural farmers
AgriDirect aims to reduce these problems by creating a direct digital connection between farmers and buyers.

💡 Solution

👨‍🌾 Farmer → 🛒 AgriDirect Marketplace → 🧑‍💼 Buyer

Farmers can list their products, manage stock and orders, while buyers can browse, search, filter and purchase agricultural produce.
